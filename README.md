## Migrating from blockstack.js

To migrate your app from blockstack.js to stacks.js follow the steps in the [migration guide](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks.js/tree/master/.github/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## Development: environment setup

To setup the development environment for this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this package.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run bootstrap` to [bootstrap](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/bootstrap) project
4. Run `npm run build` to build packages
5. Run `npm run test` to run tests

## Development: adding dependencies

This repo uses Lerna [hoisting](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/main/doc/hoist.md) for package dependencies.

In order to install a new dependency to a package, the [`lerna add`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/add) command must be used, rather than `npm install <package>`.

For example, the following command installs `lodash` as a dependency to the `@stacks/storage` package:

```shell
# Run within the root directory
npm run lerna -- add lodash --scope @stacks/storage
```

Add `--dev` to install as a development dependency:

```shell
npm run lerna -- add lodash --scope @stacks/storage --dev
```
